# BONUS ASSIGNMENT: Python Application - "Your Life in Data"
# =======================================================================================
# OBJECTIVE:
# Create a personalized Python application that analyzes data from your daily life,
# workplace, or an interest area. This assignment tests your ability to:
# - Design and implement a Python program using data structures and algorithms
# - Apply modules (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, requests, os) responsibly
# - Demonstrate understanding of control flow, functions, and file I/O
# - Integrate ethical use of AI tools, and reflect on the development process

# =======================================================================================
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# =======================================================================================

# PART 1: DATA ACQUISITION
# ------------------------------------
# Choose one of the following sources:
#   A. Export data from your phone app (e.g., steps, sleep, expenses, screen time)
#   B. Export professional data (e.g., CRM reports, GitHub commit logs, calendars)
#   C. Download public data tied to your interests (sports, food, weather, finance)
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Save your data as CSV or JSON
# - Describe the origin of your data and its structure in a comment block

# Example:
# # Source: Apple Health - Steps taken per day
# # Columns: ['date', 'steps']

# PART 2: IMPLEMENTATION
# ------------------------------------
# Write a Python program that:
# - Loads the dataset using appropriate file handling (use os.path, with open(), or pandas)
# - Cleans or preprocesses the data (e.g., missing values, type conversion, renaming)
# - Analyzes the data using algorithms you've learned (e.g., sorting, grouping, filtering)
# - Implements at least:
#     * 1 loop (for/while)
#     * 1 conditional structure
#     * 2 user-defined functions
#     * 1 dictionary or set operation
#     * 1 try-except block
# - Generates a basic data visualization (histogram, line chart, or bar chart)

# PART 3: PERSONALIZATION AND INSIGHT
# -----------------------------------------------
# - Create a new derived metric or category based on your dataset (e.g., “high usage days”,
#   “over budget”, “low productivity”, etc.)
# - Write a paragraph (in a multiline comment or markdown cell if using Jupyter) explaining:
#     * What insight you gained from this project
#     * How it relates to your life or work
#     * Any surprises or challenges encountered

# PART 4: ETHICS AND AI REFLECTION
# --------------------------------------------
# - Add a section in your code or report labeled "AI Tools Used"
# - If you used ChatGPT, Copilot, or other AI tools, list:
#     * Which tools were used
#     * How you used them (prompt example, feedback incorporation)
#     * Why their outputs were accepted, modified, or rejected
# - If no tools were used, explain why you chose not to

# =======================================================================================
# BONUS CHALLENGES
# =======================================================================================
# - Use a Flask app or Tkinter GUI to visualize your results
# - Include authentication or user input to filter results
# - Implement a scheduled update using datetime or APScheduler
# - Compare your dataset to a second external API (e.g., fetch weather for dates in dataset)

# =======================================================================================
# SUBMISSION CHECKLIST:
# =======================================================================================
# - [ ] Python script (.py)
# - [ ] Sample input file(s)
# - [ ] Inline documentation and comments
# - [ ] Personal insights & AI reflection
# - [ ] Screenshot of the output or visualization

# =======================================================================================
# REMINDER:
# Scoring 100% on this bonus will increase your final grade by 5 point.
# Do NOT copy-paste entire solutions from online sources or AI tools.
# This is an individual assignment. Plagiarism will result in a zero.
# Ensure your code is well-structured, readable, and follows Python best practices.
# Your project will be checked for originality and reviewed for effort and understanding.
